#Problem Description:-


In our academic institution, the process of connecting students with faculty-led research or course-based projects is often inefficient, fragmented, and relies heavily on informal networks or manual processes.

For Students: It's challenging to discover relevant projects that align with their specific skills, academic interests, and career aspirations. They often rely on word-of-mouth, departmental bulletin boards, or individual faculty outreach, leading to missed opportunities and a limited view of available projects. This can hinder their practical skill application and academic growth.

For Faculty: Identifying and recruiting students with the precise skills and interests required for their projects is time-consuming. Sifting through numerous applications or relying on limited departmental pools can delay project initiation and impact research productivity. There's a lack of a centralized, intelligent mechanism to efficiently find suitable student talent
Objectives


#Primary Objectives are :


-Enhance Project Discoverability: Create a centralized, easily searchable repository of all available projects, making it effortless for students to find opportunities and for project creators to attract participants.
-Improve Matching Accuracy: Implement an intelligent, skill-based matching system that accurately connects students with projects based on their profiles (skills, interests) and project requirements, providing a clear compatibility score.
-Streamline Project Management: Provide all project creators—both students and faculty—with an efficient tool to post projects, review applications, and select suitable candidates, reducing administrative overhead.
-Foster Collaboration: Facilitate both intra- and inter-departmental collaborations by making it easier for project creators to find diverse student skill sets and for students to engage in varied projects.


#Proposed Solution:-


This is a web-based platform designed as a central hub for academic project collaboration. It aims to revolutionize how students and faculty connect for research and course-based projects.
-User-Friendly Profiles & Project Listings
The platform makes it incredibly easy for everyone to get involved:

Student Profiles: Students can create detailed profiles to showcase their academic background, skills, and interests. This helps them clearly articulate their capabilities and what kind of projects they're looking for.
Project Posting: Both students and faculty members can easily post their project opportunities. Faculty can post research projects, while students can post group projects or entrepreneurial ideas. They will include comprehensive descriptions, clearly define required skills, and list preferred interests, ensuring that project needs are transparent and accessible to all.

-Intelligent Project-Student Matching
This is the core of the project, ensuring that the right students find the right projects:

Smart Analysis: The system intelligently analyzes the textual information from both student profiles and project descriptions. It goes beyond simple keyword searches to understand the deeper relationships between different skills and project requirements.
Compatibility Score: Based on this analysis, the platform calculates a match percentage. This clear, intuitive score indicates how well a student's profile aligns with a particular project's needs.

#Technology Stack:-
we will use Python Flask as backend and an MERN/HTML CSS JavaScript for frontend
